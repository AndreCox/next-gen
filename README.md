# NEXT GEN

A project generator for my next template!
The whole point of the next template was to make it easy and fast to start making apps, however it was always a pain creating multiple git repos for all my projects and modifying all the files to set up the project correctly making sure you don't miss any config files.

# Add the executable to your path
Simply download the appropriate version from the releases tab and add it to your path. Then in an empty foler simply type.
```
nextgen
```
Then the program will guide you through installation.
